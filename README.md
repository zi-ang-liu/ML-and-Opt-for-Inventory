In resent years, the integration of machine learning and optimization has been attracting increasing attention. In this presentation, I will introduce how to solve inventory management problems from the perspective of reinforcement learning. The formulation, solving methods of the newsvendor problem, the multi-period inventory problem will be discussed. In the second part, I will introduce surrogate-based optimization methods and an application of surrogate-based optimization in inventory management.
